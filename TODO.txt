TODO 

 -- VISUALIZER  --
- [X] Green -> Yellow -> Red Color Scheme for visualizer bars  
- [X] Apply some sort of filter to get less "activation" on bars, currently too full
    - [X] Make this a GUI widget
- [X] Apply Exponential Moving Average to get smoother bar action
- [ ] Highs not enough response, might be fixed with filtering
- [X] Make bar height properly scale when max num bars is changed

-- MUSIC ANALYSIS --
-[ ] BPM Analysis
    - [ ] Limit to certain frequencies (lows)
    - Get visual light to match with BPM


-- CODE STRUCTURE
- [ ] move role of calling analysis outside of visualizer  
    - visualizer should probably just get the  current necessary data it needs
    - analysis should probably be running separately in another thread etc


-- TINKERING
- [X] Knobs to apply filters


-- BUGS --
- [] Leftmost bar on visualizer not working
